# solar-cell-shading-loss
This repository models power loss in photovoltaic systems due to partial module shading. It simulates shading conditions (diffuse and direct), calculates cell-to-cell mismatch loss, and visualizes the impact on module efficiency, helping optimize solar system design and performance under real-world shading conditions.
